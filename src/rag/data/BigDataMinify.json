Gastroenteritis or colitis of infectious origin Bacterial intestinal infections Description Any condition of the intestines, caused by an infection with a bacterial source. 1A00 Cholera Fully Specified Name Intestinal infection due to Vibrio cholerae Description Cholera is a potentially epidemic and life-threatening infection of the intestine, characterised by extreme watery (secretory) diarrhoea often accompanied by vomiting, with rapid depletion of body fluids and salt that may result in hypovolemic shock and acidosis. Cholera outbreaks are caused by toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae serogroups O1 and O139. Serogroup O1 has two biovars; classical and eltor. Vibrio cholerae O1, biovar cholerae is classical type.

The characteristic widespread intensely pruritic papulovesicular rash results largely from the host response rather than directly to burrowing by mites. Where such a response is absent as in immunosuppressed or debilitated patients, unchecked proliferation of mites results in crusted scabies. Sarcoptic mites from other mammals such as dogs may cause a transient pruritic eruption. 1G04.1 Crusted scabies Description Crusted scabies results from unchecked proliferation of the human scabies mite in individuals who are unable to mount an adequate immune response to infestation.

Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis is type I allergy on the nasal mucosa.

The retention of sinus secretions is the most important event in the development of sinusitis.
