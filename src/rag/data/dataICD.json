Such specific manifestations may be a reason for treatment or encounter, with or without identifying or addressing the underlying condition.\nCategories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown aetiology' or 'transient'.\nThe conditions and signs or symptoms included in this chapter consist of:\ncases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated\nsigns or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined;\nprovisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care;\ncases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made;\ncases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason;\ncertain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right.\nThese categories should be used in conjunction with a code from another chapter that identifies the underlying condition.\nExclusions\nCertain conditions originating in the perinatal period(19)\nClinical findings on antenatal screening of mother...\n22 Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\nFoundation URI: http://id.who.int/icd/entity/435227771\nDescription\nIn the ICD, injury means physical or physiological bodily harm resulting from interaction of the body with energy (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical or radiant, or due to extreme pressure) in an amount, or at a rate of transfer, that exceeds physical or physiological tolerance. Injury can also result from lack of vital elements, such as oxygen. Poisoning by and toxic effects of substances are included, as is damage of or due to implanted devices.\nInjury usually has rapid onset in response to a well-defined event (e.g. a car crash, striking the ground after falling, drinking a strongly alkaline liquid, an overdose of a medication, a burn sustained during a surgical procedure). These events are often referred to as external causes of injury. The injurious energy can, however, originate from the injured person and/or from his or her immediate environment (e.g. a person running on a hot day sustains heat exhaustion), and injury can be caused by the injured person (i.e. intentional self-harm).\nInjury includes manifestations that are evident immediately after onset, which may persist or not, and manifestations that first become evident at a later date.\nExclusions\nStress fracture, not elsewhere classified...\nPathological fracture...\nCertain specified obstetric trauma...\nMalunion of fracture...\nBirth injury...\nNonunion of fracture...\n23 External causes of morbidity or mortality\nFoundation URI: http://id.who.int/icd/entity/850137482\nDescription\nThe WHO definition of an \u2018injury\u2019 is: \u2018Injuries are caused by acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy, heat, electricity, chemicals, and ionizing radiation interacting with the body in amounts or at rates that exceed the threshold of human tolerance. In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat. Injuries may be categorized in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:\nunintentional (i.e. accidental)\nintentional (i.e. deliberate):\ninterpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)\nself-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)\nlegal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)\nwar, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)\nundetermined intent\nRegarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply. See section \u2018Definition related to transport accidents\u2019.\n24 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\nFoundation URI: http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1249056269\nDescription\nCategories in this chapter are provided for occasions when circumstances other than a disease, injury or external cause classifiable elsewhere are recorded as \"diagnoses\" or \"problems\". This can arise in two main ways:\nWhen a person who may or may not be sick encounters the health services for some specific purpose, such as to receive limited care or service for a current condition, to donate an organ or tissue, to receive prophylactic vaccination or to discuss a problem which is in itself not a disease or injury.\nWhen some circumstance or problem is present which influences the person's health status but is not in itself a current illness or injury. Such circumstance or problem may be elicited during population surveys, when the person may or may not be currently sick, or be recorded as additional information to be borne in mind when the person is receiving care for some illness or injury.\n25 Codes for special purposes",

To guide functioning assessment, the section includes two ICF-based instruments developed by WHO: the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0 36-item version), and the Model Disability Survey (MDS). The section is complemented by a generic set of functioning categories of high explanatory power derived from the ICF Annex 9.\nX Extension Codes\nFoundation URI: http://id.who.int/icd/entity/979408586\nDescription\nExtension codes should never be used in primary classification coding or tabulation.\nThey are provided for use as supplementary or additional codes when desired to identify more detail in statistical categories classified elsewhere.\nExtension codes may be used alone in other contexts.",
